# Introduction

## What is Typst

Typst is a modern markup-based typesetting system designed to offer a powerful yet user-friendly alternative to LaTeX. 
It aims to simplify the process of creating professional-quality documents such as academic papers, reports, and presentations. 
Typst combines the precision and control of traditional typesetting tools with the flexibility of a programming language, 
featuring built-in logic, functions, and variables. Its syntax is clean and intuitive, enabling both technical and non-technical 
users to format complex documents efficiently. Typst is particularly well-suited for collaborative environments, offering fast 
compilation and real-time previews, and supports web-based editing, which lowers the barrier to entry for new users. Overall, 
Typst represents a significant step forward in document preparation, balancing ease of use with advanced typesetting capabilities.

## The need for Number Formatting

As Typst evolves into a comprehensive typesetting system, the need for advanced number and text formatting capabilities — akin to 
those found in sprintf (C/C++) or std::format (C++20, Python)—becomes increasingly essential. Complex documents often demand 
precise control over how numerical data and strings are displayed, such as padding, alignment, fixed decimal precision, localized 
number formats, and date/time formatting. Without such features, authors must rely on verbose or inefficient workarounds, which 
undermines Typst’s goal of providing both elegance and expressiveness. Integrating robust formatting tools would enhance Typst’s 
utility in scientific, technical, and data-driven documents, supporting dynamic content generation, programmatic layout logic, 
and multilingual output. Ultimately, these capabilities are foundational for bridging the gap between high-level typesetting and 
low-level data presentation, making Typst a more competitive and versatile platform for modern publishing.
